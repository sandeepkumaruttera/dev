need to keep this python code boto 3 in aws lambda that it ,and configuration time should be 3 sec that it 

import boto3

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    ec2 = boto3.client('ec2')

    # Get all EBS snapshots
    response = ec2.describe_snapshots(OwnerIds=['self'])

    # Get all active EC2 instance IDs
    instances_response = ec2.describe_instances(Filters=[{'Name': 'instance-state-name', 'Values': ['running']}])
    active_instance_ids = set()

    for reservation in instances_response['Reservations']:
        for instance in reservation['Instances']:
            active_instance_ids.add(instance['InstanceId'])

    # Iterate through each snapshot and delete if it's not attached to any volume or the volume is not attached to a running instance
    for snapshot in response['Snapshots']:
        snapshot_id = snapshot['SnapshotId']
        volume_id = snapshot.get('VolumeId')

        if not volume_id:
            # Delete the snapshot if it's not attached to any volume
            ec2.delete_snapshot(SnapshotId=snapshot_id)
            print(f"Deleted EBS snapshot {snapshot_id} as it was not attached to any volume.")
        else:
            # Check if the volume still exists
            try:
                volume_response = ec2.describe_volumes(VolumeIds=[volume_id])
                if not volume_response['Volumes'][0]['Attachments']:
                    ec2.delete_snapshot(SnapshotId=snapshot_id)
                    print(f"Deleted EBS snapshot {snapshot_id} as it was taken from a volume not attached to any running instance.")
            except ec2.exceptions.ClientError as e:
                if e.response['Error']['Code'] == 'InvalidVolume.NotFound':
                    # The volume associated with the snapshot is not found (it might have been deleted)
                    ec2.delete_snapshot(SnapshotId=snapshot_id)
                    print(f"Deleted EBS snapshot {snapshot_id} as its associated volume was not found.")



i am policy for that aws lambda

{
	"Version": "2012-10-17",
	"Statement": [
		{
			"Sid": "VisualEditor0",

		}
	]
}




deleting s3 bucket empty using below code
----------------------------------------------

import boto3

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    s3 = boto3.client("s3")
    deleted_buckets = []
    skipped_buckets = []

    try:
        # List all buckets in the account
        response = s3.list_buckets()
        buckets = response.get("Buckets", [])

        for bucket in buckets:
            bucket_name = bucket["Name"]
            try:
                # Check if bucket is empty
                objects = s3.list_objects_v2(Bucket=bucket_name, MaxKeys=1)
                if 'Contents' not in objects:
                    # Empty bucket — delete it
                    s3.delete_bucket(Bucket=bucket_name)
                    deleted_buckets.append(bucket_name)
                else:
                    skipped_buckets.append(bucket_name)
            except Exception as inner_err:
                skipped_buckets.append(f"{bucket_name} (error: {str(inner_err)})")

        return {
            "statusCode": 200,
            "body": {
                "deleted_buckets": deleted_buckets,
                "skipped_buckets": skipped_buckets
            }
        }

    except Exception as e:
        return {
            "statusCode": 500,
            "body": f"Error: {str(e)}"
        }

 If you want to sound more technical (but still clear):
Lambda is part of AWS’s serverless computing model.

It supports several languages like Python, Node.js, Java, Go, etc.

It scales automatically — if 1 or 1000 users hit it, AWS handles the load.

It’s commonly triggered by events, like:

A new file in S3

A new message in SNS or SQS

An HTTP request via API Gateway

You can use it for real-time processing, automation, microservices, or backends without servers.

---------------------------------------


Want to make it run automatically?

Connect it to an API Gateway → run it when someone hits a URL

Trigger it from S3 → when someone uploads a file

Run it on a schedule → like a cron job

Let me know which use case you want — I can walk you through that too.

----------

* Summary
AWS Lambda = serverless function

You only write the code. AWS handles the servers.

You can trigger it from HTTP, file uploads, events, schedules, and more.

--------------------------------------------------------


Would you like to:

Connect Lambda to a public URL using API Gateway?

Trigger Lambda when a file is uploaded to S3?

Run Lambda on a schedule (like every hour)?

Or deploy it from your local machine using the AWS CLI?
